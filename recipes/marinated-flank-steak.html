    <h2>How to Cook Flank Steak</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of ways to perfectly cook a flank steak. In this recipe, the steak is grilled â€” we love the
        bold, smoky flavor the grill gives the meat. But you can also easily cook your flank steak in the oven or on the
        stove. You'll find the step-by-step recipe for marinated and grilled flank steak below, but here are some rough
        guidelines for three different flank steak cooking methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On the grill</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Preheat a lightly
            oiled outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and
            grill on each side to desired doneness. The steak is done when a meat thermometer inserted into the center
            reads between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>In the oven</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Remove the steak from
            the marinade, shake off excess liquid, and arrange the steaks in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil.
            Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads between 130 degrees F and 145
            degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>On the stove</strong>: Season and marinate the steak according to your recipe. Sear the steaks in a
            cast-iron skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, then flip to the other side and repeat. Finish the
            steaks in a preheated oven. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the steak reads
            between 130 degrees F and 145 degrees F.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How Long to a Flank Steak</h3>
    <p>It depends on the degree of doneness you're after. This marinated flank steak should be totally cooked after
        about 5 minutes of grilling time on each side. Of course, tastes and preferences will vary.</p>
